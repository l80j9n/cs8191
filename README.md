Corporate Finance 
Clarkson Lumber Co – Part 1
Read the Clarkson   Lumber Company case.    To   help you   organize   your   thoughts   for   the case discussion during class, attempt the   assignment   below.   (Hint:   do   not   focus   on   the decision to form. a   new   banking   relationship,   instead focus on the   assignment   questions,   largely   based on the exhibits   instead of   the   text.) There are a   lot of questions,   some   possibly   a   little   difficult. Try   to   do   as   much   as   you   can.   In class, we will go over   all the   questions   step-by-step,   but   it’s   important   you   attempt   all   questions to   understand the solutions.
You do not need to submit   a solution   to   this   case.
Questions   1-2 of this assignment are   intended   review the   concept   of   Free   Cash   Flows (FCF)   using   historical   information. Questions 3-7 are step-by-step   calculations to   project   FCF   in   1996. 
Assignment 
1.       Generate the Statement   of   Cash   Flows for   Clarkson   for   the   year   ending   in   1994.
Notes: We   have   not done this   in class,   but you   should   know   how to   construct   this statement from your accounting class.   Below, you will find   a   worksheet   to   help   you.   Hint:   During   1994,   Mr. Clarkson   bought   Mr.   Holtz’s   interest   in the firm. This transaction   increases debt   by $200   (see total   notes   payable to   Mr.   Holtz) and   decreases   net worth   by $200   (share   repurchase). 
2.       Compute the free   cash   flows   for   the   same   year.
Notes: To compute the taxes,   use the tax   rate   information   in   note   (c)   to   Exhibit   1.
3.       For questions   4   to   6,   we   will   need   some   key   financial   ratios.   Compute   the   following   ratios for 93, 94, 95   and their   average   for   the   period.
•          Income Statement
i.         COGS/Sales
ii.         Operating expenses/Sales
•          Balance Sheet
i.       Net   Fixes   Assets Turnover   (NFATO)   =   Sales/netPPE
ii.       Accounts   Receivable   Days on   Hand   (AR   DOH) =AR/(Sales/365)
iii.       Inventory   Days   on   Hand   =Inventory/(COGS/365)
iv.         Accrued   Expenses/Sales
4.       Suppose that sales   in   1996   are   $5.5   million.   Project   NOP. Assume:
•         This   is an “average” year compared to 93-95. This   implies, for   example,   that   you should   project COGS so 代 写Clarkson Lumber Co – Part 1Python
代做程序编程语言that   the   COGS/Sales   ratio   in   1996   equals the average of this   ratio   in the 93-95   period. Question   3   lists the   key   financial   ratios you   can   use. 
•         Taxes are given   by the schedule described   in   note   (c)   to   Exhibit   1.
•         Clarkson does   not get any trade   discounts.
5.         Project   netPPE and the change   in   netPPE.
6.         Project the change   in   NWC.
•          For accounts   receivables,   inventory, and accrued expenses   assume   that
1996   is an average year and   use   relevant   ratios   in   question   3.
•         To   project, accounts   payable assume that accounts   payable days   on   hand   in   1996   is 45   (AP   DOH =AP/(Purchases/365)).
•          Hint: You will   need   to estimate what   purchases   will   be   in   1996.
Remember that   Inv(t) =   Inv(t-1) +   Purchases(t) – COGS(t). So   you   should   have   projected enough   information already to   back out what   purchases   will   be for   1996.
•         All of the “Notes   payable” on Clarkson’s   balance sheet   are   interest   bearing   liabilities.
7.       Using your   answers from   questions   4,   5,   and   6,   project   the   FCF   in   1996.
Discussion Questions 
1.       How does   cash   flows   from   operating,   investing   and   financing   activities   relate   to   the   FCF?
2.       For   many of   our   projections   we   multiply   a   ratio   by   sales.   What   are   we   assuming   about the   production function?

*Typically we add   back depreciation as   part   of the   adjustments to   net   income   in   the operating activities section.   In this worksheet, we are   adding   back   depreciation   when   computing the   increase   in   net fixed assets   in the   investing activities section.
